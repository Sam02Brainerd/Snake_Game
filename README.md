Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic arcade-style game where you control a growing snake as it navigates a field to eat food and grow longer. With every bite, the game becomes more challenging as the snake speeds up. This project is built using Python and Pygame, combining fun gameplay with clean design and interactive elements.

Features
Smooth Gameplay: The game runs at a consistent frame rate for a seamless experience.
Dynamic Difficulty: The snake's speed increases as it eats more food, making the game progressively challenging.
Pause and Resume: Players can pause the game at any time and resume where they left off.
Custom Dialog Boxes: Interactive dialog boxes for starting the game, pausing, and showing game-over screens.
Looping Boundaries: The snake wraps around the edges of the screen for endless gameplay.
User Interface (UI): Displays the current score and includes intuitive buttons for interaction.



How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
1. Up Arrow: Move Up
2. Down Arrow: Move Down
3. Left Arrow: Move Left
4. Right Arrow: Move Right
Collect the red dots (food) to grow your snake and increase your score.
Avoid colliding with your own body; otherwise, the game will end.

This project is a fun learning journey into game development using Pygame, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
